    Not My Video -- Credit: Triple S Games 'on youtube'
        Notes:
            The game will automatically end and restart once a character has '3 in a row'
            I will begin to work on an ai starting November 10th.

             The window size may need to be adjusted depending on the size of your monitor -- Example
            My Screen:
            WIDTH = 100 * line;
            HEIGHT = 100 * line;
            Yours(potentially):
            WIDTH = 104 * line;
            HEIGHT = 108 * line;
            simply go into the game and drag the mouse o none of the corners or sides of the window to adjust it until you see an even grid of tiles.
