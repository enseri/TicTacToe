        Notes:
            The game will automatically end and restart once a character has '3 in a row'
            I will begin to work on an ai starting November 10th.

             The window size may need to be adjusted depending on the size of your monitor -- Example
            My Screen:
            WIDTH = 100 * line;
            HEIGHT = 100 * line;
            Yours(potentially):
            WIDTH = 104 * line;
            HEIGHT = 108 * line;
            simply go into the game files find these lines and adjust them to the proper size
            this will allow you to see the entire board.
